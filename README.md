# minute-vim
Colourless colourscheme with as little fluff as possible

4 colours is all I want: black (000), darker grey (237), grey (007), white (015)

Should work with any language, but has not been optimised for any.

If you want a 16 colour version do the following:
```sh
sed "s;237;darkgrey;" -i colors/minute.vim
```
